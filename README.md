## Challenges

This was a very challenging project for me. I know that there is a more concise way to create this application. I wanted to create a connection.js file that would host the connection to mySQL, an orm.js that would contain orms, a series of classes representing each mySQL table, a prompts.js that would contain all of the inquirer prompts and finally, a server.js that would run the program with all of the other files working in the background. However, learning how to integrate all of these components all together has proved to be very challenging for me and will take some time/practice to learn how to do.

## Final Thoughts

This project is far from perfect, but works. I will work to learn how to make a cleaner, more comprehensive final product in my next project.
